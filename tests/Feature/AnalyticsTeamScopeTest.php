 * AnalyticsDashboard directly as a user on a different team, with no
 * manual scoping anywhere in the path, still cannot see the row. This
 * is the property that makes the scope "defense in depth" rather than
 * decorative — it holds even if a future controller or Livewire
 * component forgets to scope a query explicitly.
